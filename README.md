# goSTAG-for-more-species
Python and R scripts to use goSTAG on exotic species.

[goSTAG](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/goSTAG.html) can be used for a little set of species (human, mouse and rat). These scripts create the needed files used by goSTAG so the package could be used on exotic species.

More informations, tests and examples will come later.
